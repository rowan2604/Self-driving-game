# Self-driving-game
Creation of an autonomous car game that learns from its mistakes through a reward system. Project carried out in 2D using 5 data of the distances between the car and the collision walls.
This project allowed me to improve my ability to not give up until the project is finished, I took a lot of distance on how to proceed and think about machine learning models.
Technologies : Python, keras, Tensorflow, Adam, Models, Reinforcement Learning ,DeepLearning.
